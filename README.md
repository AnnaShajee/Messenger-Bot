# Messenger-Bot

Main module to be developed is in app.py

weather.py and events.py describe the APIs and parameters required to use them.
The other files can be ignored.

If the wit response can be sent to the facebook messenger bot, the other APIs can be integrated here.
Later, quick reply option (with map location) for the 'Where' response needs to be integrated.

Extra links for reference are available in Links.txt
